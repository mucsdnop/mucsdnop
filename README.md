- 👋 Hi, I’m @mucsdnop
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about Python and how it may be useful in terms of AI and/or machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular.  I'm a bit odd in that I try to be a solo act but that doesn't mean I won't want help when it comes up.
- 📫 How to reach me is by using the email jmartiniii@ivytech.edu and if things get more personal I'll exchange more information.
